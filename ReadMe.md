# Sliding Window Ranker

Sliding Window Ranker is a C# library that provides efficient algorithms for ranking elements within a sliding window
over a sequence of data. This can be useful for various applications such as real-time data analysis, signal processing,
and more.

## Features

- Support high-performance ranking of a generic List of values in a window of size N where a new value is added to the
  right side of the window and the oldest one is removed from the left side of the window.
- The window size defaults to the count of the initial values provided to the constructor, but can be smaller, even
  zero, if fewer values are available.
- The number of partitions K defaults to the square root of the window size (which is usually close to optimal) but can
  be specified if desired.
- By removing earlier data, ranking is no longer against "stale" data. But specifying a window size of int.MaxValue
  causes earlier values to never drop off.
- The fraction returned is the Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF) value for the specified value except that CDF is
  normally defined as LESS THAN OR EQUAL rather than LESS THAN. So, the values returned will be in the range ([0, 1] NOT
  inclusive of 1) rather than [0, 1] inclusive.
- The fraction returned can be multiplied by 10 to get a decile rank or by 100 to get a percentile rank.

## Usage

Here's a simple example of how to use Sliding Window Ranker:

var ranker = new SlidingWindowRanker<double>(initialValues);
var rank = ranker.GetRank(value);
